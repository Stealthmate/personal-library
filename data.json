Honestly, some of the things here are understood only when you actually build a (bad) microservice system, but nevertheless it provides a lot of insight about why you might want to split certain systems, instead of having one giant one. It touches on a variety of topics, including communication, security, testing etc and it features pretty modern technologies, so it serves as a nice overview of the area.\n",

The book gives an overview of common principles in the industry - from the well-known SOLID principles, to other lesser known but equally important ideas. To put it simply - if you want to sound more convincing when you tell your manager that you need to do some major refactoring, then this book is for you.\n",
