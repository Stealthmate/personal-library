Honestly, some of the things here are understood only when you actually build a (bad) microservice system, but nevertheless it provides a lot of insight about why you might want to split certain systems, instead of having one giant one. It touches on a variety of topics, including communication, security, testing etc and it features pretty modern technologies, so it serves as a nice overview of the area.\n",

The book gives an overview of common principles in the industry - from the well-known SOLID principles, to other lesser known but equally important ideas. To put it simply - if you want to sound more convincing when you tell your manager that you need to do some major refactoring, then this book is for you.\n",

If you're currently working in a company where DevOps is the norm, it might feel like the book is stating the obvious. On the other hand, if you're working in a company that's a little more traditional... well, this book will open your eyes.\n",

That being said, the ideas inside are valuable regardless of the choice of technology - the book does a good job explaining why the concept of peer review in software is good. Then again, on the surface there are some points that could be considered \"old\" by today's standards - reviewing code printed on paper, having long and formal meetings where multiple people \"inspect\" the code, etc.\n",
