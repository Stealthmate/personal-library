Honestly, some of the things here are understood only when you actually build a (bad) microservice system, but nevertheless it provides a lot of insight about why you might want to split certain systems, instead of having one giant one. It touches on a variety of topics, including communication, security, testing etc and it features pretty modern technologies, so it serves as a nice overview of the area.\n",

The book gives an overview of common principles in the industry - from the well-known SOLID principles, to other lesser known but equally important ideas. To put it simply - if you want to sound more convincing when you tell your manager that you need to do some major refactoring, then this book is for you.\n",

Then again, on the surface there are some points that could be considered \"old\" by today's standards - reviewing code printed on paper, having long and formal meetings where multiple people \"inspect\" the code, etc.\n",
